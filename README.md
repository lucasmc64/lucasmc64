I am a Computer Science student, a Front-end Developer, a Computer Technician, a friend and a son.
But at the end of the day, I'm human like everyone else: full of little problems involving anxiety, procrastination and self-sabotage. And it all culminates in various projects and dreams that are never fulfilled or even started.
How does this information contribute to a good presentation? I don't know, but I like popcorn :)
